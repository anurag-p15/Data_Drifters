            India's rapid development over the last two decades is undeniable, yet the persistent issue of students leaving education prematurely
            casts a shadow on our progress. The reasons for this alarming trend are diverse, encompassing deeply rooted ideologies, gender
            discrimination, and other complex factors. Recognizing and addressing this challenge is not only a necessity but also an opportunity
            to unlock the full potential of our youth and pave the way for a brighter and more equitable future. Some major insights gathered during
            the analysis of data are mentioned as below. Data was derived from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 3) , including information on schooling and dropout reasons for children aged 5-18.
